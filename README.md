# Wood Packaging

Every year, hundreds of billions of merchandise is imported to Canada.  All of this merchandise was shipped in some combination of types of packaging material. Certain types of packaging material can pose a significant threat to Canadaâ€™s plant health by acting as pathway for pests, diseases, or invasive species.  In order to mitigate this risk, the CFIA has developed guidelines for oversight activities for inspecting packaging materials, in collaboration with Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA).


In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of targeting of packages for inspection, our team at CFIA has developed a tool that  can accurately identify high-risk wood packages with regards to compliance verification.
